The assorted bash scripts in this repository are released under the GPLv2. Why? Well, since the main programs used by these scripts (MeshLab, OpenSCAD, Blender & ADMesh) are all released under the GPLv2, it seems a no-brainer to follow suit. These scripts would not be possible without this excellent software.
