#3DL Scripts
Bash shell script library for [MeshLab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) scripting, plus small drag-n-drop apps to help prepare models for 3D printing.

This library is no longer being maintained or updated, as it has grown far beyond what can comfortably be accomplished in bash. It has been reimplemented in Python; please refer to [MeshLabXML](https://github.com/3DLIRIOUS/MeshLabXML) and [pylirious](https://github.com/3DLIRIOUS/pylirious).
